How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous. Benefits & Diversity At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. In 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company’s success. We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are.

A key positive aspect of the SIX engagement model with clients is the quality and expertise of the staff and resources we deploy is support of the sales force during the sales process. The Regional Manager Role in SSO role is primarily responsible for the delivery and management of product, service and sales support in the defined region. Some regions will operate on a ‘hub and spoke’ basis where a number of countries are supported as ‘spokes’ from the central location. The rational for this is to allow the development of resources in strength and depth and to allow the limited support staff in smaller countries to access the resources and expertise of an entire department easily and quickly. 2. The Regional Manager will organize and manage resources on a regional basis to provide effective sales support to the three sales channels. It is envisaged that these services will include data consulting, integration services, API and interfacing training and consulting and client facing project management, i.e. to facilitate the sales of our complete offering of products and services both technically and administratively. 3. Functionally, this will cover pre-sales support, quote/proposal production, support for entitlements set up, delivery and installation etc. In most of these elements, there is the need to liaise effectively with the global group who have ultimate responsibility for the function e.g. Finance, Legal, Technology etc. 4. Resources (both in terms of quantity and skill set) should be planned so that support can be economically and efficiently provided where it is required, with some skills provided locally, and others provided regionally (or in a few cases globally) to achieve the economies of scale and scope. Where possible and sensible, these should map onto the organization of the sales channels to foster a close and supportive working relationship. 5. Certain team members will also take on responsibility for ‘Expert Support’ working closely with GDO, MPP and the Partner business . This will mainly be for problems or service/content deficiencies that need to be pro-actively managed to a successful conclusion on a client-by-client basis over a period of time. We expect that the majority of the ‘Expert Support’ is actually provided by the Project Managers – they manage the long term problems to resolution and are well placed to manage the expectations of the client – something that a helpdesk by its very nature cannot do easily. It addition, SSO will have the domain experts that may well be required for analysis of detailed or ongoing problems. The Regional Manager may well get involved in particularly difficult or high visibility problems, including leading to a resolution. 6. Many projects will involve working alongside business partners by offering integration support for SIX data into a partner’s solution, or integrating an element from the partner into a solution provided by SIX. The SSO group will work closely with the Partners team to deliver such integration and project support. Of particular importance here is the recognition, protection and growth of the value that SIX adds into the overall solution such that we do not get marginalized by an aggressive partner. It is also important that such solutions lead to repeatable, high value sales opportunities for SIX, rather than remaining as ‘once-off’ deals. Your Profile We are looking for a self-starter who can work independently yet be equally comfortable working within a team within a matrix organisation.  A solid understanding of Market Regulation and its impact on Financial institutions and regulatory topics is necessary, as is a general knowledge of a variety of asset classes (Equity, Fixed Income, Commodity, Funds and FX markets).  An appreciation of the compliance and regulatory framework within financial institutions.  Good presentation, documentation and communication (oral and written) skills. Ability to build strong relationships with prospects, clients and internal stakeholders and document detailed requirements.  A solid understanding of Sales and Project Management lifecycles.  Demonstrate enthusiasm to learn about, and maintain, their knowledge of the details of the market, including regulation, competitive positioning, technical issues around data delivery and current ‘hot topics’ in the industry."

LTD.,Head of SSO (APAC),"SUNTEC TOWER TWO, 9 TEMASEK BOULEVARD 038989",Full Time,Middle Management,"Banking and Finance, Others","$144,000to$216,000",Monthly,"RequirementsMain Duties 1. A key positive aspect of the SIX engagement model with clients is the quality and expertise of the staff and resources we deploy is support of the sales force during the sales process. The Regional Manager Role in SSO role is primarily responsible for the delivery and management of product, service and sales support in the defined region. Some regions will operate on a ‘hub and spoke’ basis where a number of countries are supported as ‘spokes’ from the central location. The rational for this is to allow the development of resources in strength and depth and to allow the limited support staff in smaller countries to access the resources and expertise of an entire department easily and quickly. 2. The Regional Manager will organize and manage resources on a regional basis to provide effective sales support to the three sales channels. It is envisaged that these services will include data consulting, integration services, API and interfacing training and consulting and client facing project management, i.e. to facilitate the sales of our complete offering of products and services both technically and administratively. 3. Functionally, this will cover pre-sales support, quote/proposal production, support for entitlements set up, delivery and installation etc. In most of these elements, there is the need to liaise effectively with the global group who have ultimate responsibility for the function e.g. Finance, Legal, Technology etc. 4. Resources (both in terms of quantity and skill set) should be planned so that support can be economically and efficiently provided where it is required, with some skills provided locally, and others provided regionally (or in a few cases globally) to achieve the economies of scale and scope. Where possible and sensible, these should map onto the organization of the sales channels to foster a close and supportive working relationship. 5. Certain team members will also take on responsibility for ‘Expert Support’ working closely with GDO, MPP and the Partner business . This will mainly be for problems or service/content deficiencies that need to be pro-actively managed to a successful conclusion on a client-by-client basis over a period of time. We expect that the majority of the ‘Expert Support’ is actually provided by the Project Managers – they manage the long term problems to resolution and are well placed to manage the expectations of the client – something that a helpdesk by its very nature cannot do easily. It addition, SSO will have the domain experts that may well be required for analysis of detailed or ongoing problems. The Regional Manager may well get involved in particularly difficult or high visibility problems, including leading to a resolution. 6. Many projects will involve working alongside business partners by offering integration support for SIX data into a partner’s solution, or integrating an element from the partner into a solution provided by SIX. The SSO group will work closely with the Partners team to deliver such integration and project support. Of particular importance here is the recognition, protection and growth of the value that SIX adds into the overall solution such that we do not get marginalized by an aggressive partner. It is also important that such solutions lead to repeatable, high value sales opportunities for SIX, rather than remaining as ‘once-off’ deals. Your Profile We are looking for a self-starter who can work independently yet be equally comfortable working within a team within a matrix organisation.  A solid understanding of Market Regulation and its impact on Financial institutions and regulatory topics is necessary, as is a general knowledge of a variety of asset classes (Equity, Fixed Income, Commodity, Funds and FX markets).  An appreciation of the compliance and regulatory framework within financial institutions.  Good presentation, documentation and communication (oral and written) skills. Ability to build strong relationships with prospects, clients and internal stakeholders and document detailed requirements.  A solid understanding of Sales and Project Management lifecycles.  Demonstrate enthusiasm to learn about, and maintain, their knowledge of the details of the market, including regulation, competitive positioning, technical issues around data delivery and current ‘hot topics’ in the industry."
